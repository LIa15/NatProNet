This directory contains the clustering result file for natural products, `drug_cluster_non_weak_0.3.pkl`. The file is in Python dictionary format, structured as `'CHEMBL100259': 822`, where the key represents the ChEMBL ID (`chembl_id`), and the value indicates the cluster to which it belongs.

In addition, there are three files: `drug_ECFP.pkl`, `drug_PubChem.pkl`, and `drug_ASP.pkl`. These files store the features of the natural products in our dataset. The format is a Python dictionary, where the key represents the ChEMBL ID, and the value contains the feature values. Calculation method: https://github.com/dahvida/NP_Fingerprints.
