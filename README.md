# NatProNet
Overview
It uses machine learning techniques to predict interactions between natural products and proteins.The original version of the code, including all key files and datasets. The feature files (*.pkl) required for machine learning are too large. A link to them will be provided in the README file later.

The following environment and dependencies are required to run the project:
- **Python**: 3.8
- **PyTorch**: 1.8.1 (Note: Higher versions may cause errors. Some code modifications may be required for compatibility.)
- **TorchVision**: 0.9.1
- **XGBoost**: 2.1.3
- **PyTorch Geometric**: 1.6.3
- **Torch-Scatter**: 2.0.7
- **Torch-Sparse**: 0.6.10
- **Scikit-learn**: 1.3.2
- **RDKit**: 2024.3.2
